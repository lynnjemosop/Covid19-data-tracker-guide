Key Insights & Patterns (Markdown Cells for Jupyter Notebook)
1. Top Countries by Total Confirmed Cases
The United States, India, and Brazil recorded the highest number of total COVID-19 cases.
These three countries consistently dominated the charts across various timeframes, indicating widespread transmission and high testing/reporting capacity.

2. Fastest Vaccine Rollout
Israel and the United Arab Emirates were among the first countries to fully vaccinate a large portion of their populations, with over 50% fully vaccinated early in the global campaign.
In contrast, many African countries lagged behind, with full vaccination rates below 10% for extended periods.

3. Daily New Cases Surges
Countries like India experienced sharp spikes in daily new cases during the second wave (Aprilâ€“May 2021), significantly impacting healthcare systems.
Anomalies were observed in countries like Kenya, where sharp increases in reported cases occasionally appeared due to batch reporting or limited testing infrastructure.

4. Death Rate Variations
The death rate (total deaths / total cases) was highest in countries with older populations (e.g., Italy, the UK) and/or limited healthcare capacity.
Countries with low testing may have underreported cases, inflating their apparent death rate.

5. Geographical Patterns
A choropleth map revealed that wealthier countries had higher case detection and vaccination rates, especially in North America and Europe.
This reflects not just virus spread, but differences in reporting, infrastructure, and access to healthcare and vaccines.
